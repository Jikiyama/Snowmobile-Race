The Snowmobile Race was a project created for the 2018 annual video games week in Miami Dade College.
The idea was to create a Java FX race which randomized the movement of cars, so that the outcome of the race was not pre-ordained.
The program loads a thread for every car on the race, and concurrently updates their X coordinate on the pane.
